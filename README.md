👋 Hey there, I'm David (@samsondavid381)

🚀 Currently obsessed with AI integrations and making complex data actually useful

🎓 Recently wrapped up my CS degree at UCF, but honestly learned more from breaking things than I ever did in lectures

🌍 When I'm not coding, you could find me learning with new languages (currently butchering Hebrew verb conjugations)

🤝 Always down to collaborate on projects that push boundaries - especially if they involve AI doing something it probably shouldn't be able to do yet
